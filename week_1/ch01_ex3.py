Algorithm: integer division
input: dividend, divisor
output: integer quotient = dividend/ divisor

remainder = dividend - divisor
check if remainder >0.
if so, keep subtracting divisor from  remainder,
    repeat the subtraction until remainder <0
count how many of divisors have been subtracted
quotient = number of subtracted divisors -1
